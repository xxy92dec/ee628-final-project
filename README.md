## Introduction
I want to make an app for teachers. This app can assist teachers to evaluate students' handwritten math answer from homework, quiz and exam. 

It can automatically judge students' final answer is right or wrong. 

## Database
Database: MNIST database and other database if necessary.

## Basic Function
For Solution given by teachers
It can read simple math question from a txt file, then get the answer of these questions.


For Solution given by students
It can read handwritten answers in a answer book line by line.

## Some problems cannot be solved
Can't find a good dataset for math symbol and numbers. So currently, teachers have to input solution.
This project can only detect and classification handwritten digits line by line.

## About 2 ipynb file
Classification.ipynb	is the model-trainning file
Final-project.ipynb is image procession and prediction file
Final-project.ipynb upload model trained in Classification.ipynb
