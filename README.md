# Introduction
I want to make an app for teachers. This app can assist teachers to evaluate students' handwritten math answer from homework, quiz and exam.

It can automatically judge students' final answer is right or wrong. 

# Database
Database: MNIST database and other database if necessary.

# Basic Function
It can read handwritten answers in a answer book line by line.
